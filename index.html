<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Interest in IT</h1></div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
<p>My personal fascination with it is the interactions and how programs behave in complex situations, this was started by Valves Team Fortress 2 but solidified by Blizzard entertainments Overwatch witch both feature unique characters with roles that have to function collaboratively to obtain/control an objective while utilizing and combining their own ability's. These concepts form an array complex idea actively working in conjunction led to my eagerness to understand IT and all my experience was taught by my farther and furthered by self-teaching which led me to building my own computer and many for others. I chose RMIT for its extensive support and recourses available to any given student from both their structured online support and active teachers, from this study I hope to develop a more stable foundation to learn from and to advance my own skillsets, to make me a more qualified of an individual within my desired career path and have a better understanding of my opportunity's within IT.</p>

<p>Metagame Systems Programmer is a role in which actively improve the efficiency of code in a given product and the implementations of new systems or blocks of code with the integrity of performance and function over anything else primarily functioning in teams. Various teams will be given tasks to operate on to a deadline much like movie editing to make the movie play as well as the story was wrote originally, the requirements are heavily orientated with prior experience with visual c++ and unreal engine witch works towards their titles that are AAA game titles across many platforms as well as the need to be extremely driven in your work and competent in team dynamics and problem solving generally they request an example of your work to qualify for a position. Relatively I am inexperienced in visual C++ and unreal engine but do have small amounts of game design experience from editing save files (Ricks Game Stuff) and various game elements in which I've leant to read a lot of code relevant to titles Gearbox produces such as BioShock and Borderlands. Doing as such I need to further my experience in modifying code to a means of efficiency for program function rather than breaking the game rules and become more team orientated in my future endeavors by means of an internship or prior work with another game industry to have some qualified experience within the specific field of game production.</p>

<p>1.16Personalitys-Advocate: I think these results are somewhat astoundingly accurate and detail my wants to make lasting change or actively impact the world around me in a positive/constructive manor to avoid issues all together, when it comes to team work, I am greatly capable of flexible responsibility's but need independence in segments to gather thoughts and maintain composure within a collaborative environment. This would be vital to make apparent when apart of or developing a team as without space I'll find myself incapable of unwinding and be constantly exhausted and incapable of sustaining a work life balance.</p>

<p>2.education planer- learning style- auditory: Againe I find the result accurate although less so I do learn great when listening, I find a visual demonstration most vivid and memorable as I account most things in an eidetic fashion so it’s a case of, I need both from what I can tell, this would allow me to function greatly as a subordinate. I can follow instruction intuitively but can struggle to delegate when a lead so in order to have a lead role I would have to have great passion and extensive pre up skilling for managing a team.</p>

<p>3.VIA Character Strengths-(Judgement): reassuring to know that my test results are similar in the sense that they all refer me as an active individual that requires balance to maintain function with a keen ability to observe and attempt to recreate beauty, can work within teams well and work fluently. But personally require clear instruction and personal space to work within being considerate of my peers is a key goal from understanding this, and from this I would be well capable of formulating a group but would struggle to maintain without guidance or prior experience.  </p>

<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Project Idea Overview:</h1></div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>My idea is to create a standalone unity first person shoot based arena game project that would entail individual characters with ability's and therefore accompanying designs and roles that they serve in the games replay ability and unique interactions or match ups within a team-based setting of 3v3 in a player verse player environment dedicated to supporting each character in a soft counter manor. Where the individual skill and objective control of the map as a team will provide overall success with said the characters themselves will have skill ceilings to witch a player works within.</p>

<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Motivation</h1></div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>The drive my intentions come from a title developed by Respawn Entertainments Apex Legends a game I've invested over 300 hours of my life into over three seasons I've experienced several iterations of Patch and balance changes and would like to have a game orientated around the balance of key interactions as frequently when playing my favorite title if find the game stale. I need to play with x character with x weapon regardless of my skill cap and I would love to make a game where abilities have impact but don’t control the game (“But a lack of updates, a litany of bugs, and some fierce competition has destroyed Apex Legends”). This being primary concern in a sense create a state of equal power of potential regardless of matchup a case of how you use your ability not what ability you use as games, with “Apex Legends enjoyed an average of around 200,000 concurrent viewers for its first couple of weeks, but since has dropped to an average of around 50k” This is primarily due to the long-lasting game states in which particular ways of playing the game inherently win.ie revenant, wraith, lifeline, Gibby and crypto where the only characters in high level scrims or ranked games making the game repetitive play wraith get R99 win I don’t like that.</p>

<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Description</h1></div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>As a game based around balance the majority of what I plan is the characters and their unique capability's given each other and how that would interact as a hole and provided that I have 4-character descriptions and a game mode idea base permits of the game being to control the map angles and a dedicated area in which a powerful item would be introduced to assist a decisive team victory. There are two-win conditions time (the team with the highest health values remaining wins) and elimination (full team wipe) in a best of three setting with a round time of 2 minutes the dropped item coming in at the half time. Map control and pressure is key with each team swapping sides each time making it a mechanically focused game the power items comprising of 5 (pistol, sniper, beam type, grenade and shield) which comprise of dmg values and an effect which will drastically impact the game state based upon the experience/ mechanical skill of the individual player same goes for the characters witch each have their own variables to make gameplay unique while maintaining balance. The initial characters pertaining the roles of a light, support, heavy and flank themselves all have passive effects such as healing and delay to heal start on taking damage but each have their own ability which requires changes to their base values to compensate whilst maintain viability for each in a standalone pressure battle for space but a mechanically better player will generally win.  
The light would pertain a smaller hitbox but accompanying lower heath with a high mobility ability and a light sub machine like gun that requires twitch reflexes and constant tracing to effectively deal with the opposition, 
The support will have a higher self-passive as well as a healing ability which are empowering for a team and individual but she must be close to the fragility of the light as to not run through a team with raw hp the weapon would be a pistol like and require skill shot and angle positioning to capitalize upon the powerful healing the character possesses. 
the heavy is a difficult role to not make broken in symbiosis with a healer so tanks hp cannot be to high notable the hp in the game much the in integer per second rather than % as this would make tank overly powerful in the same sense so he will have higher health points but receive less hp per second and his ability is a wall like object that can be destroyed by anyone as an opportunistic cover for a reposition for yourself or a team mate and his weapon a low mag assault rifle as to be powerful but not be able to walk into a team and deck the lot with no penalty.  
The flanker would be the middle ground between a light and heavy in terms of hp and be flexible in utility providing a tactical reposition for himself allowing cover for two possible places at a single fight this requires fine tuning in the same way the other characters do as to not rule the game to do so the redeploy would need a way of interruption via dmg or destroying the redeploy itself but this means his weapon will be a revolver type to make his ability skill based rather than spray and prey. 
Each of the characters and weapons require values that are not define net but are detailed in the illustrations below as basic ideas to represent the characters and drop items, notably I would need a set of maps for the game mode to function within which I have added a mock illustration for.</p>

<div class="sectionContent">
<p>Unity 3 (2020.1) will be the project program that I would develop with and I would utilize the DOTS sample to learn of the software I am utilizing to learn the networking game mechanics and the direct programing language to be able to create and split/edit ability's and create my characters and items then furthermore the maps themselves. With my small knowledge in C++ I would begin to learn rendering through the  
HDRP (High-Definition Rendering) as well as the attached hitbox logic and physics engine that unity inherently uses and most likely look into the Unity assets store to fast track around hard curve balls I stumble across learning.</p>

<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Skills Required</h1></div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>to be able to use unity properly I would require a more extensive background in C++ in order to manipulate the code to the game I wish then I would need to possess extensive research of the API that are offered for visual rendering of the project, the physics engine and interactions that entail, the internal and external communications for the range of the unity systems. These can mostly be found though various service that Unity provides like “Unity Teams”, “Connected Games” one I need to learn for online compatibility function and “Analytics” a in depth tool kit readily available to study although this would take a few years as a minimum.</p>

<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Outcome</h1></div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>The result of the project is a fully functional first-person shooter game with class-based characters that are in a unique gameplay setting with accessibility for high skilled gameplay with ability's unique to each character and a balance orientated set of weapons/ gameplay rules that would be capable of replay ability promoting player experience. With individual characters or items based upon the mechanical output of a player to witch I would hope to continue to develop maps and or characters and even game modes with the key goal of viability for the individual and team play within a single game made for the strive of skill.</p>
